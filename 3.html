    <h3><strong><u>Introduction</u></strong></h3>
    <p>This section is non-normative.

  <u> <a href="https://www.w3.org/">JavaScript</a></u> is the World Wide Webâ€™s core markup language.<br>
   Originally,
  HTML was primarily designed as a language for semantically describing
  scientific documents.<br> Its general design, however, has enabled it to be
  adapted, over the subsequent years, to describe a number of other types of
  documents and even applications.

<p>This specification is intended for authors of documents and scripts that use the features defined in this specification, implementors of tools that operate on pages that use the features defined in this specification, and individuals wishing to establish the correctness of documents or implementations with respect to the requirements of this specification.</p>
<p style="margin-top:45px;">This document is probably not suited to readers who do not already have at least a passing familiarity with Web technologies,
  as in places it sacrifices clarity for precision, and brevity for completeness. <br>
  More approachable tutorials and authoring guides can provide a gentler introduction to the topic.</p>
